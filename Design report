                                                                                                                        Introduction
For this milestone I am building a rest api for my store front application. I based the application on the design I made in the previous milestone with slight adjustments but it overall follows the logic.

                                                                                                                        Requirements

The minimum function my rest api must be able to achive is to support the basic Crud Operations:

Create
Read
Update
Delete

and to also test the api in post man.
