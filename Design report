                                                                                               Introduction
For this milestone I am building a rest api for my store front application. I based the application on the design I made in the previous milestone with slight adjustments but it overall follows the logic.

                                                                                               Requirements

The minimum function my rest api must be able to achive is to support the basic Crud Operations:

Create
Read
Update
Delete

and to also test the api in post man. 

The rough draft of my previous design, specially the logic I planned to implement is as follows:


                                                                                                 Product API

One of the requirements this week was to introduce the API concept for my application. I am making a simple Product API, the following is a draft of the concept;
HTTP Verbs – the requirements are that a product needs to be created, updated, listed, and deleted. The HTTP verbs that are associated and that I will be using are,
• POST – Create 
• PATCH – Update
• GET – List
• DELETE – Delete 
Examples code of Product API:
"actions" : {
"get" : {
 "method" : "GET",
 "href" : "http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/products/47738"
},
"update" : {
 "method" : "PATCH",
 "href" : "http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/products/47738"
},
"delete" : {
 "method" : "DELETE",
 "href" : "http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/products/47738"
}


As shown above, my current api follows the logic presented in my previous rough draft albiet with slight changes. Firstly, rather than PATCH for the update operation, I used PUT instead. Also, the gateway
to localhost I used was 3000 rather than 8080. However aside from those changes I followed through with my planning.
